 Responsive Desktop to Mobile Website Example

This project demonstrates how to convert a desktop-only webpage to a mobile-friendly layout using CSS media queries and responsive design techniques.

 Overview

The provided single HTML file includes:

- A header navigation menu that collapses into a hamburger toggle on smaller screens (max-width 768px).
- A hero section with a background image and centered text.
- A three-column layout for "Services", "About Us", and "Contact" sections on desktops, which stacks vertically on mobile devices.
- Images that scale responsively to fit within their containers.
- Reduced font sizes and adjusted spacing for small viewports.
- Smooth toggle of the navigation menu on mobile devices using simple JavaScript.

 How to Use

1. Open the file `responsive-desktop-to-mobile.html` in any modern web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
2. Resize the browser window to see the layout adjust between desktop and mobile views.
3. On screens 768px wide or less, the navigation menu collapses behind a hamburger icon.
4. Click or tap the hamburger icon to toggle the mobile navigation menu.
5. The columns stack vertically for easier reading on narrow screens.
6. Images and text scale to fit smaller screen sizes without overflow or horizontal scrolling.

 Testing with Chrome DevTools

1. Open the file in Chrome.
2. Press `F12` or right-click and select "Inspect" to open DevTools.
3. Click the device toolbar icon (Toggle device emulation) or press `Ctrl+Shift+M`.
4. Choose different devices or set custom widths to test responsiveness.
5. Verify layout changes, navigation toggle, and image scaling.

 Project Goals

- Practice CSS media queries with max-width breakpoints.
- Implement mobile-first design principles.
- Create flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- Use simple JavaScript to enhance navigation usability on mobile.
